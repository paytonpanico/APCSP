    <p class = "p">The image above was from the Collage Project for my US History class. This project was supposed to reflect 3 major themes from the "Conflict and Social Discontent" unit which essentially consists of the Vietnam War. In order to complete this project, a partner and I had to analyze the unit, come up with three themes, and then write paragraph which correspond to a collage reflecting the information we found.The three themes we came up with were "Containment", "Nationalism", and "Unified Protests".</p>

    <p class = "p"> The image above was from the APCSP Technology Innovations Project for my computers class. This picture was an infographic describing the uses of Flash Forest Drones. In order to complete this picture, I had to research all about what these drones do and how they are able to do it. I learned that these tree-planting drones are far more efficient than traditional planting methods. The company, Flash Forests, hopes that these drones will plant 1 billion trees by 2028. </p>
